EasyRugPull 1.3.7

🚀 About
EasyRugPull is a rapid-deployment toolkit for creating and launching experimental ERC-20/BEP-20 tokens on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Base. Designed for developers, researchers, and educators, it streamlines the entire lifecycle—from contract generation and liquidity-pool setup to automated market-making and instant dApp listing. All contracts are pre-audited templates with configurable tokenomics, anti-bot measures, and emergency controls.
